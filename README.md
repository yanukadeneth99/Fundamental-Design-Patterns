# Fundamental Design Patterns (GOF) Examples

## Singleton Pattern

Create a class called Login using the Singleton Design Pattern.

The Login class should have a method called validateUser(String user, String password). For this question you can return true if the user and password values are matching otherwise return false.

Create a class called LoginMain. Here in the main method, create two variables of the Login class and get objects using the Login Singleton.

Use the validateUser() method to validate username = “User”, password = “Password”.

In the main program write code to validate that the two variables of the Login class refer to the same object.

## Abstract Factory Pattern
