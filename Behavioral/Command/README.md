# Command Behavioral Pattern

The Command Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that focuses on encapsulating a request or an action as an object. It allows you to separate the sender of a request from the object that performs the action. This pattern is particularly useful when you want to parameterize objects with operations, delay the execution of a request, or queue requests for execution.
